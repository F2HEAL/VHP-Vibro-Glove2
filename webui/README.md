# Web UI via BLE

This HTML page provides a simple way to connect to a web UI via BLE.

Currently only working with the Chrome Browser with the 'enable-experimental-web-platform-features' flag enabled.

Change this in your browser by going to: 

     chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features



This interface allows to start/stop and configuring of the parameters of the device.
