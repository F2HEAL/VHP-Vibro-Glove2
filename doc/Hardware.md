# Board / MCU

We used the board developed in the [Google Audio-to-tactile](https://github.com/google/audio-to-tactile) project (Big thanks!). It is an open source board with a Nordic nRF52840 MCU.

It's not commercially available it this form and needs to be produced from the specifications provided [here](https://github.com/google/audio-to-tactile/blob/main/extras/doc/hardware/index.md). 

# Components

The rest of the components needed can be found in the [BOM](doc/BOM).
