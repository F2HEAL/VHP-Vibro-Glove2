For EEG recordings of evoked potentials (like sensory-evoked, auditory-evoked, or somatosensory-evoked potentials), trigger jitter should ideally be less than 1 millisecond, and in many cases, much lower:

Good: < 1 ms jitter

Better (for research-grade EP studies): < 200–300 microseconds (µs) jitter

Best (for high-precision studies like very early components, e.g., brainstem responses): < 100 µs jitter
